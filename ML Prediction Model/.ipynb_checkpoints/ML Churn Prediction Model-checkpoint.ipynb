    "# **Machine Learning Churn Prediction Classification Model**\n",
    "### **Random Forest Algorithm**\n",
    "A random forest is a machine learning algorithm made up of multiple decision trees. Each decision tree is trained on a **random subset of the dataset(rows) and its features** to make end model more diverse. The final prediction is obtained by averaging the predictions (for regression tasks) or taking the majority vote (for classification tasks) from all the trees in the forest. This ensemble technique enhances the accuracy and robustness of the model by minimizing the risk of overfitting compared to using a single decision tree.\n",
    "\n",
    "So,\n",
    "- Random forests or random decision forests is an ensemble learning (multiple models) method for classification, regression: <br>\n",
    "    **Meaning:**<br>\n",
    "  Random Forest is a machine learning algorithm that combines many decision trees to make better and more accurate predictions.<br>\n",
    "  ~ Classification → Predicting categories (e.g., spam or not spam)<br>\n",
    "  ~ Regression → Predicting continuous values (e.g., house prices) <br>\n",
    "  🧠 Think of it as a group of trees (a forest) voting together instead of trusting a single tree.\n",

    "- Random decision forests correct for decision trees' habit of overfitting to their training set.<br>\n",
    "**Meaning:**<br>\n",
    "~ A single decision tree often memorizes training data (overfits - low bias(well trained on training data, High Variance(errored prediction  when used for unseen new data) ), performing poorly on new data.<br>\n",

    "> Training many trees on slightly different data subsets<br>\n",

    "**================= How it Works: =================**<br>\n",
    "**Step1: Create Bootstrap Dataset from Original data by Randomly choosing data (repetition is allowed).** <br>\n",
    "**Meaning:**<br>\n",
    "- We create multiple random samples (called bootstrap samples) from the original dataset.<br>\n",
    "**Each sample:**\n",
    "> Is made by randomly picking sample rows <br>\n",
    "> Allows repetition, so some rows may appear more than once i.e., some rows will be used for multiple Decision Trees <br>\n",
    "> Others may not appear at all <br>\n",
    "\n",
    "- 🧠 This gives different training sets for each tree → more variety = more robustness.<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "**Step2: Create Randomized Decision Tree from Bootstrap Dataset.** <br>\n",
    "**Meaning:** <br>\n",
    "- Each bootstrap dataset is used to train one decision tree.\n",
    "- But while splitting, each tree also:\n",
    "> Looks at only a random subset of features (columns) instead of all <br>\n",
    " → This adds even more randomness and prevents trees from becoming too similar.\n",
    "\n",
    "🧠 So every tree learns a different pattern or angle of the data.\n",
    " \n",
    "**Step3: Finally output of the random forest is the class selected by most trees (for classiication) or avg (regression).** <br>\n",
    "**Meaning:** <br>\n",
    "- After all trees make their predictions: <br>\n",
    "> For classification → use majority voting (most common class wins) <br>\n",
    "> For regression → use average of all tree predictions\n",
    "\n",
    "🧠 Think of it like 100 experts giving opinions — you take the majority (or average) for a more reliable answer.\n",
